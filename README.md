## Abstract
We want to be able to predict the rating of a movie before it is released. We want to be able to input a movie or upcoming movie title and output the predicted movie rating.

# Table of Contents
* [Week 3](#weekthree)
* [Week 4](#weekfour)
* [Week 5](#weekfive)
* [Week 6](#weeksix)
* [Week 7](#weekseven)
* [Week 8](#weekeight)
* [Week 9](#weeknine)
* [Week 10](#weekten)

## Basic flowchart outline of the project
![Alt Text](/MovieRatings.png?raw=true "flow chart")

## Aspects:
+ Rotten Tomatoes API (Kaggle, IMDB) -previous movies of that genre and their rating
+ Data Algorithms (weighting actors vs. directors vs. budgetâ€¦)

+ Query data about movie title or movie id to get parameters
+ Query previous ratings of rating parameters
#
+ Create a method of storing data and accessing it from different parts of the program
+ Some sort of statistical analysis on ratings (Data algorithms)
+ Create an interface or web app to take input and display results
#
+ Factors available to use: 
  + Average movie rating
  + Actors
  + Director
  + Producers
  + Budget
  + Studio
  + Writers
  + Genre
  + Cinematographer
  + Music
  + ect...

## Data Sources:
+ API rotten tomatoes
+ API imdb
+ API themoviedb
+ Kaggle

## Languages:
+ Python
+ HTML

## Blockers
+ Themoviedb has a 40 query per 10 second limit per api key.
+ Other api's probably have similar restrictions.
